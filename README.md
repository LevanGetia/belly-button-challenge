#Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
Overview
The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard provides an interactive platform to explore and visualize the biodiversity of microorganisms found in human navels. This project leverages advanced web visualization tools to present data insights from the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset.


#Features
Dropdown Menu: Select a test subject's ID to view individualized data.
Demographic Information Panel: Displays metadata information for the chosen individual.
Bar Chart: Showcases the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) present in the selected individual.
Bubble Chart: Visualizes the frequency of all bacterial species found in the selected individual.
Gauge Chart: Represents the weekly washing frequency of the selected individual's belly button.

#Technologies Used
JavaScript: For data manipulation and visualization.
D3.js: To create interactive visualizations.
Plotly: For creating the charts.
Bootstrap: For frontend layout and design.

#Dataset
The data used in this dashboard comes from the Belly Button Biodiversity project, which explores the microbial species in human navels. The dataset comprises samples from multiple individuals, capturing various microbial species' OTU IDs and their corresponding frequencies.
